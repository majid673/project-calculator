# Project Calculator

Welcome to Project Calculator! This is a smart web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a wide range of mathematical operations, from basic arithmetic to advanced functions, and includes features like equation solving, history tracking, and a responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and percentage calculations.
- **Advanced Mathematical Functions**: Supports functions like square root, power, factorial, logarithms (log₁₀, log₂, ln), trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, sinh, cosh, tanh), exponential (exp), and constants (π, e).
- **Equation Solving**: Solve algebraic equations for `x` using the Nerdamer library.
- **Memory Functions**: Includes memory operations (MC, MR, M+, M-) for storing and recalling values.
- **History Tracking**: Keeps a history of calculations with the ability to toggle visibility.
- **Copy Result**: Easily copy the result of calculations to the clipboard.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes for better usability.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero).

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the calculator interface.
- `style.css`: Contains custom CSS styles for the calculator design.
- `script.js`: Includes JavaScript for handling calculations, user interactions, and advanced mathematical operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries**:
  - **Bootstrap 4.5.2**: For responsive styling and layout.
  - **Nerdamer**: For solving algebraic equations and advanced mathematical operations.
  - **Math.js 11.8.0**: For additional mathematical computations.

## How to Run Locally

To run the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:  git clone https://github.com/majid673/project-calculator.git
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:   cd project-calculator
3. **Open the application**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser:  
- Double-click the `index.html` file, or  
- Right-click and select "Open with" > your browser (e.g., Chrome).  
Note: The calculator uses external libraries loaded via CDN (Bootstrap, Nerdamer, Math.js), so an internet connection is required to run the application.
